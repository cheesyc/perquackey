# perquackey

Windows:
1. Install Python. Any version should work
2. Clone the git file into somewhere you can remember. Unzip the file if it needs to be
3. Open command prompt (Windows Key + R -> Type "cmd" and hit enter) and type in "Python"
4. Change directories (cd [file name]) to the file you saved it in
5. Type "perquackeyscore.py" to run the program. If that doesn't work (I haven't used Windows in awhile) type "python perquackeyscore.py"
6. Rinse and repeat as needed

Linux:
1. Clone the file into a place you can remember
2. Unzip the file if you need to (unzip [filename] in terminal)
3. Open up the terminal -> cd into the file it is downloaded in -> python perquackeyscore.py
